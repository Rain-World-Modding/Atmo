/// Base class for triggers. Triggers determine when happens are allowed to run; They are composed into a <see cref="PredicateInlay"/> instance, that acts as a logical expression tree. Derive from this class to define your custom trigger to be used in <see cref="API.AddNamedTrigger(string, Atmo.API.Create_NamedTriggerFactory, bool)"/> overloads, or use the event-driven child <see cref="EventfulTrigger"/> if you prefer composition with callbacks here as well.
/// <para>
/// This expression: <code> WHEN: (maybe 0.7 OR karma 1 2 3) AND fry 25 5 </code> will be turned into a set of happentrigger children that do the following:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>A <see cref="Maybe"/>, that takes argument 0.7. Each cycle, this will either be active with 70% chance, or inactive with 30% chance.</item>
/// <item>A <see cref="OnKarma"/>, that is active when the player's current karma is 1, 2 or 3.</item>
/// <item>A <see cref="Fry"/>, that takes two arguments: activity limit and cooldown. It will always be active, but turn off (for 5 seconds) once the happen is active for long enough (25 seconds).</item>
/// </list>
/// These objects' collective response to <see cref="ShouldRunUpdates"/> will be checked up to once each frame. Expressions follow normal boolean logic stucture, operator precedence is NOT > AND > XOR > OR.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Note that <see cref="PredicateInlay.Eval"/> can short-circuit, so some of the triggers may not receive a call to their <see cref="ShouldRunUpdates"/> every frame. In this example, evaluation starts with Maybe, then goes on to Karma. If at least one of them is true, Fry gets evaluated; if they are both false, expression short-circuits, and Fry is not evaluated.
/// </para>
/// NOTICE: As of now, all trigger children mentioned in above example are deprecated and serve only as code samples. For builtins, <see cref="EventfulTrigger"/> is used instead.
