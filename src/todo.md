## Do
- World state specvars ($cycletime, $karma etc) (currently readonly)
- DevConsole integration
- Placed triggers
- Actions for abstract world (creature spawns, object creation, lineages)

## Maybe
- Move specvars into metafunctions

## Done
- Make sure realtime postfix in docs is everywhere it needs to be
- Make the parser wrap up the last block if EOF but it's missing an end
- Better format macro 
- Continuous setvar
